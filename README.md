# matlab-dependency-analysis
Analyses code at selected locations. Detemines the dependencies between the functions. Then creates a set of web pages to display the results.
It requires graphviz to be installed in order to generate the dependency graphs.
Run the analysis using the init script which bootstraps the loading of matlab, as well as setting up the required environment variables and getting the code to be analysed.
